TODO
    - bug: isSignaling() and class() don't test properly for SNAN on all implementations
      <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=117041>

    - add the "is_xxxx", sign-copy, and other similar functions from IEEE754/Data::Float
      <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116155>
      + IEEE754 5.4.2 => 5.12
        <format>-convertFormat
        <format>-convertFromDecimalCharacter
        <format>-convertToDecimalCharacter
            # alias for to_dec_floatingpoint()
            # conversionSpecification is supposed to indicate formatting
            #       might want to use an optional integer which indicates how many places
            #       after the fractional-point to display (default to 16 => %16.16s for to_dec_floatingpoint)
      + IEEE754 5.4.3 => 5.12
        <format>-convertFromHexCharacter
        <format>-convertToHexCharacter(source, conversionSpecification)
            # alias for to_hex_floatingpoint()
            #       I originally thought these were aliases for my rawhex754 functions... but no
            # conversionSpecification is supposed to indicate formatting
            #       might want to use an optional integer which indicates how many places
            #       after the fractional-point to display (default to 16 => %16.16s for to_dec_floatingpoint)

    - long-term: add in _32bit and _128bit versions
      - what's official name of 128bit long-double?  quad?  something else?  check IEEE754
        doesn't give a name (mentions, but never defines, single and double)
      - 128b = [1 sign][15 exp][112 frac], e=exp-16383

    - ALWAYS: look for new bug reports:
