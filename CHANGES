Revision history for Perl module Data::IEEE754::Tools.

v0.011_001 In Progress
    - nextup():
        * Could not replicate <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=116006>,
          so adding diagnostics to nextupdown/nextafter test suite;
        * by copying the nextup code, but with additional diagnostics, inside the test
          wrapper, and forcing a fail for diagnostics, saw that when LSB underflows (goes to -1),
          the hexification is too many F's; perhaps on some systems, that was being misinterpreted
          when the two were being recombined.
        * hopefully, my alpha _001 release to CPAN Testers will prove or disprove this theory
    - Test suite for :floatingpoint now converts SNAN to expect /[SQ]NAN/,
        because it doesn't really matter that much whether Perl silences a signaling NAN
        * this should fix <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=116005>
    - Test suite for :raw754 now switches to '==' comparison for numeric arguments
        * this should fix <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=116004>
    - Test suite now requires 64bit (8byte) NV during install
        * I am curious whether this will fix <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=116006>
