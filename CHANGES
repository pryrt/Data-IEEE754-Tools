Revision history for Perl module Data::IEEE754::Tools.

TODO: v0.010 initial release?

v0.008 Thu Jul 07
    - Start simplification of expand_ieee754() to to_hex/dec_floatingpoint(),
      using BrowserUK's suggestion that simpler is better.  They utilize the
      more standard "-0x1.0123456789abcp+0000" notation
    - remove expand_ieee754
    - rename val_toggle_ulp to toggle_ulp
    - update test suite / names
    - add nextup(), nextdown(), nextafter(), and tests
    - bug fix ulp/next*.t: include IND in the list of NAN|INF|IND
      to ensure that on systems that distinguish -1.#IND from -1.#NAN,
      it will still use the text-eq instead of numeric-==.
    - bug fix nextafter.t: for nextafter(*NAN, +NAN), need to expect
      the value (*NAN), not the direction (+NAN).
    - bug fix to_xxx_floatingpoint(-1.#IND) and associated floatingpoint.t:
      comparing against wrong $mant for -1.#IND, and wrongly expecting -1.#QNAN
