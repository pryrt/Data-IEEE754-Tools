Revision history for Perl module Data::IEEE754::Tools.

v0.14003 2016-Aug-29
    - had to switch to dotted-decimal notation
    - removed the 'provides' so I don't do this to myself again

v0.014002 2016-Aug-29
    - It categorized v0.014001 as a major release; however, due to
      bad data in the META, it lists it as v0.14001.0.  I hope
      I'll be able to release as v0.014002 with the fixed META version
      without CPAN complaining about going backwords in version.
      Otherwise, I'll have to call it 'v0.16000.0' in the declare,
      and get rid of that stupid 'provides'.

v0.014001 2016-Aug-29
    - had a bug in the makefile which caused CPAN to not index the v0.014
      release.  Add version => 'v0.014001' to provides subhash,
      and try to release without the underscore (I think that should allow
      a 6-character number but without marking it as alpha/developer.
      If not, I will come back and release as v0.016, which I'd rather not do

v0.014 2016-Aug-29
    - feature request <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116155>
      + add many functions
        :ulp => ulp, nextUp, nextDown, nextAfter
        :info => isSignMinus, isNormal, isFinite, isNaN, isSignaling,
            isSignalingConvertedToQuiet, isCanonical, class, radix, totalOrder,
            totalOrderMag, compareFloatingValue, compareFloatingMag
        :signbit => copy, negate, abs, copySign, isSignMinus
    - feature request <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116154>
      + add :constants
    - feature request <https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116153>
      + update ulp() with new, faster method

v0.013
    - Odd versions are development versions, used for developing and verifying
      new features and bug fixes.  There may have been one or more alpha
      subversions (v0.013_001, etc).

v0.012 2016-Jul-14
    - test coverage: Devel::Cover showed two conditionals which can only ever
        trigger one of the two (impossible to hit the opposite); remove the
        unnecessary conditional
    - bugfix <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=116005>: get SNAN,
        expect QNAN
      - original code always expected QNAN, because all of the developer's
        machines automatically quiet SNAN to QNAN
      - v0.011_001: Test suite for :floatingpoint now converts SNAN to expect
        /[SQ]NAN/, because it doesn't really matter that much whether Perl
        silences a signaling NAN
    - bugfix <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=116006>
      - getting NAN instead of expected value on nextup(NEGATIVE NORMAL) or
        nextdown(POSITIVE NORMAL)
      - v0.011_001: when LSB underflows (goes to -1), the hexification is too
          many F's; misinterpreted when the two were being recombined, so masked
          the MSB and LSB before merging
    - bugfix <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=116004>
      - test suite getting -0.160000000000000003 when expecting -0.16
      - caused by systems with $Config{nvsize} > 8: code expected 64bit NV (some
        CPAN Testers have 128bit NV)
      - v0.011_002: change test suite to only compare enough significant figures
        for a 64bit double, so that even 128bit floats (quad?) will pass
      - v0.011_004: added documentation to explain that the module expects
        64bit NV, rounds off more-precise NV floats to 64bit, and will fail
        tests on 32bit NV (but might coerce to 64bit floats and might still
        "work" if the installation is forced)

v0.011
    - Odd versions are development versions, used for developing and verifying
      new features and bug fixes.  There may have been one or more alpha
      subversions (v0.011_001, etc).
