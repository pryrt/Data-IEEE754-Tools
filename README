NAME

Data::IEEE754::Tools - Various tools for understanding and manipulating the underlying IEEE-754 representation of floating point values

DESCRIPTION

It appears that L<Data::Float> includes most of the functionality, but using IEEE 754
standard function names... That may be a better choice, unless you've got a need
for one of these specific implementations.

The L<IEEE754|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point> standard describes
various floating-point encodings.  The double format (`binary64') is a 64-bit base-2
encoding, and correpsonds to the usual Perl floating value (NV). The format  includes the
sign (s), the power of 2 (q), and a coefficient (c): C<value = ((-1)**s) * (c) * (2**q)>.
The C<(-1)**s> term evaluates to the SIGN of the number, where s=0 means the sign
is +1 and s=1 means the sign is -1.
The coefficient is internally encoded as an implied 1 plus an encoded FRACTION,
which is itself encoded as a 52-bit integer divided by an implied 2**52.

L<Data::IEEE754>, or the equivalent L<perlfunc/pack> recipe L<dE<gt>>, do a
good job of converting a perl floating value (NV) into the big-endian bytes
that encode that value, but they don't help you interpret the value.

This B<Data::IEEE754::Tools> module takes it to the next step, and provideds
the tools to expand the encoded floating point value into its component sign,
fraction, and exponent, so you can see how it is encoded internally.

There are also functions available to let you know what the
L<ULP|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_in_the_last_place> ("Unit in the Last Place")
is for a given value, and another that returns the original value, but modified
by just one ULP (toggle the ULP bit).
