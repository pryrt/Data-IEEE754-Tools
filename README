NAME

Data::IEEE754::Tools - Various tools for understanding and manipulating the underlying IEEE-754 representation of floating point values

DESCRIPTION

These tools give access to the underlying IEEE 754 floating-point
representation used by Perl (see perlguts). They include functions for
converting from the 64bit internal representation to a string that shows
those bits (either as hexadecimal or binary) and back, functions for
converting that encoded value into a more human-readable format to give
insight into the meaning of the encoded values, and functions to
manipulate the smallest possible change for a given floating-point value
(which is the ULP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_in_the_last_place>
or "Unit in the Last Place").

INSTALLATION

To install this module, use your favorite CPAN client.

For a manual install, type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

(On Windows machines, you may need to use "dmake" instead of "make".)
